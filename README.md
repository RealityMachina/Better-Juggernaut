# Better-Juggernaut
Get your pilots super gud at punching things.

Juggernaut will now:

1) let melee attacks use sprinting distance instead of normal walking distance

2) will have melee attacks no longer count as a move: technically speaking, this means that Bulwark will now be applicable to melee attacks.
